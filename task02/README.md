## 1 Christ in the Book of Mormon

It is often quoted that some form of Christ's name is used an average of once every 1.7 verses in
the Book of Mormon. Numbers such as 3471 references to the Savior are often quoted in talks [[1]].
Higher numbers like 3925 are also used [[2],[3]].

These mostly come to reference *Finding Christ through the Book of Mormon* (1987), pages 16-18, by
Susan Easton Black. This has also been mentioned in an Ensign article by the same author [[4]].
