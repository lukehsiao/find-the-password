        <h1 id="finding-the-password">Finding the password</h1>
        <p>I have a text file with 50,000 passwords (one password per line). I seem to have lost my password in this file. Can you help me find it?</p>
        <h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>
        <p>The list of passwords is available at:</p>
        <pre><code>https://challenge.hsiao.dev/03/u/&lt;name&gt;/passwords.txt</code></pre>
        <p>Where <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is your username (e.g., <code>alexh</code>).</p>
        <p>You can check if a password is the one I lost by checking the website with it in the URL following this template:</p>
        <pre><code>https://challenge.hsiao.dev/03/u/&lt;name&gt;/check/&lt;password&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>For example, if my username is <code>luke</code> and I wanted to test the password: <code>testpass</code>, I would visit</p>
        <pre><code>https://challenge.hsiao.dev/03/u/luke/check/testpass</code></pre>
        <p>And I'd see the response:</p>
        <pre><code>False</code></pre>
        <p>If I get the right password, I'd see:</p>
        <pre><code>True</code></pre>

        <li>No sharing a solution with each other, everyone has to do their own work, but you're free to collaborate.</li>
        <li>If you can solve it, you have to share with me what you did.</li>
        <li>Only use the url with your own name in it, don't impersonate others.</li>
        <li>There is no limit to how many times you can try. If you want to completely restart, we can reset your user.</li>
