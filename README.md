# Code Challenges for Youth

A collection of coding challenges for youth.

## Running

Typically run on a \$5/month DigitalOcean droplet running Ubuntu. This runs Rocket.rs, but I put
that behind a [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) server with the included Caddyfile for easy HTTPS.
All run in a tmux session for the duration of the challenge.
