        <h1 id="finding-the-password">Finding the password</h1>
        <p>I have a text file with 20,000 passwords. I seem to have lost my password in this file! Can you help me find it?</p>
        <p>Of course, there will be prizes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>1st Place: $30</li>
        <li>2nd Place $15</li>
        <li>3rd Place: $10</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>
        <p>The list of passwords is available at:</p>
        <pre><code>https://challenge.hsiao.dev/03/&lt;name&gt;/passwords.txt</code></pre>
        <p>Where <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is your username (e.g., <code>alexh</code>).</p>
        <p>You can check if a password is the one I lost by checking the website with it in the URL following this template:</p>
        <pre><code>https://challenge.hsiao.dev/03/&lt;name&gt;/check/&lt;password&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>For example, if I wanted to test the password: <code>testpass</code>, I would visit</p>
        <pre><code>https://challenge.hsiao.dev/03/luke/check/testpass</code></pre>
        <p>And I’d see the response:</p>
        <pre><code>False</code></pre>
        <p>If I get the right password, I’d see:</p>
        <pre><code>True</code></pre>
        <p>You can check some stats about everyone’s attempts by visiting</p>

        <h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>No sharing a solution with each other, everyone has to do their own work, but you’re free to collaborate!</li>
        <li>If you can solve it, you have to share with me what you did!</li>
        <li>Parents are not allowed to help much. I’ll leave it to parents’ judgement on what “much” is. When in doubt, feel free to send them to me!</li>
        <li>Only use the url with your own name in it, don’t impersonate others!</li>
        <li>There is no limit to how many times you can try!</li>
        <li>I will update this email thread as prizes are claimed!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="some-solutions">Some solutions</h2>
        <p>Brute force is the only answer.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Ideally, this is a trivial for loop over the passwords and making a web requests, checking for “Yes” in the response.</li>
        <li>Turns out you can also use a spreadsheet, leveraging something like <code>=WEBSERVICE</code> to make the web requests for you. Turns out Google Sheet’s <code>IMPORTDATA</code> only allows 50 per sheet, so no go there.</li>
        <li>Some kids actually did brute force, turns out 10k wasn’t crazy enough! Their approach was to use a multiple tab opener and literally open hundreds of Chrome tabs, closing them quickly as they kept their eyes trained on where “No” and “Yes” were displayed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When we teach kids to ride a bike, at some point we have to take the training wheels off. Here’s an idea. When they hit eleven, give them a plaintext file with ten-thousand WPA2 keys and tell them that the real one is in there somewhere. See how quickly they discover Python or Bash then.</p>
